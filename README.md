Writing a research paper for a conference is a tedious process. However, a standard writing style could serve as a template that helps in fast generation of research paper in the latex format. #PaperPushPush aim to speedup the process of generating paper in latex format by automating as many tasks as possible, including the following:
- Automatic download of document class for a conference
- Automatic detect the system configuration for experiment section  
- Start with standard wordings for each session
